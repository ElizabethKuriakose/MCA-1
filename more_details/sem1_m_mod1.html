    <b class="red r4-h2">SETS  </b>

    collection of well defined and distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right

        N : the set of all natural numbers
        Z : the set of all integers
        Q : the set of all rational numbers
        R : the set of real numbers
        Z+: the set of positive integers
        Q+: the set of positive rational numbers
        R+: the set of positive real numbers

        (i) Objects, elements and members of a set are synonymous terms.
        (ii) Sets are usually denoted by capital letters A, B, C, X, Y, Z, etc.
        (iii) The elements of a set are represented by small letters a, b, c, x, y, z, etc.
 
        <b class="red r4-h2">Representing a set </b>

        (i) Roster or tabular form
        (ii) Set-builder form.

        <b class="red r4-h2">Empty set / Null set / Void set</b>

        B = { x : x is a student presently studying in both Classes X and XI }
        In mathematics, the empty set is the unique set having no elements; 
        its size or cardinality (count of elements in a set) is zero. 

        Some axiomatic set theories ensure that the empty set exists by including an axiom of empty set,
         while in other theories, its existence can be deduced.
        empty set is denoted by the symbol φ or { }

         
        <b class="red r4-h2">Finite and Infinite Sets</b>

        A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
        C = { men living presently in different parts of the world}
        A set which is empty or consists of a definite number of elements is called finite 
        Otherwise, the set is called infinite.            
    

        <b class="red r4-h2">Equal Sets</b>

        Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {3, 1, 4, 2}. Then A = B

        sets A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {2, 2, 1, 3, 3} are equal

        <b class="red r4-h2">Subsets</b>
        A set A is said to be a subset of a set B if every element of A is also an element of B
        A ⊂ B if a ∈ A ⇒ a ∈ B

        <b class="red r4-h2">Power Set</b>

        The collection of all subsets of a set A is called the power set of A 
        It is denoted by P(A). In P(A), every element is a set
        P( A ) = { φ,{ 1 }, { 2 }, { 1,2 }}

        <b class="red r4-h2">Operations on Sets</b>

        Union of sets
        A ∪ B and usually read as ‘A union B’ 
        Intersection of sets 
        A ∩ B = {x : x ∈ A and x ∈ B}
        Difference of sets
        A – B and read as“ A minus B”

        <b class="red r4-h2">Union of sets</b>

        (i) A ∪ B = B ∪ A (Commutative law)
        (ii) ( A ∪ B ) ∪ C = A ∪ ( B ∪ C) (Associative law )
        (iii) A ∪ φ = A (Law of identity element, φ is the identity of ∪)
        (iv) A ∪ A = A (Idempotent law)
        (v) U ∪ A = U (Law of U)

        <img src="library/img/m9.png">

        <b class="red r4-h2">Intersection of sets</b>

        (i) A ∩ B = B ∩ A (Commutative law).
        (ii) ( A ∩ B ) ∩ C = A ∩ ( B ∩ C ) (Associative law).
        (iii) φ ∩ A = φ, U ∩ A = A (Law of φ and U).
        (iv) A ∩ A = A (Idempotent law)
        (v) A ∩ ( B ∪ C ) = ( A ∩ B ) ∪ ( A ∩ C ) (Distributive law ) i. e.,
         ∩ distributes over ∪

         <img src="library/img/m10.png">

         <b class="red r4-h2">Difference of sets</b>

         A – B = { x : x ∈ A and x ∉ B }

         <b class="red r4-h2">Complement of a Set</b>

         Let U be the universal set and A a subset of U. Then the complement of A is the set of all elements of U which are not the elements of A. 
         Symbolically, we write A′ to denote the complement of A with respect to U. Thus,
         A′ = {x : x ∈ U and x ∉ A }. Obviously A′ = U – A
                    
         <img src="library/img/m12.png">

         <b class="red r4-h2">Properties of Complement Sets</b>

         1. Complement laws: (i) A ∪ A′ = U (ii) A ∩ A′ = φ
         2. De Morgan’s law: (i) (A ∪ B)´ = A′ ∩ B′ (ii) (A ∩ B)′ = A′ ∪ B′
         3. Law of double complementation : (A′)′ = A
         4. Laws of empty set and universal set φ′ = U and U′ = φ
